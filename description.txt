--- Pacifist Route ---
by GabeHasWon
commissioned by sivaexo

This mod allows you to spare/mercy some bosses, letting them live alongside you.
Each boss has their own pacification requirements, most of which are not hitting the boss for a few minutes while managing to stay alive.
Each boss has a unique effect or town pet version when pacified.

Currently, the mod goes up to and includes all prehardmode bosses.
