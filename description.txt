--- Pacifist Route ---

commissioned by sivaexo
community ideas from Great Grand Stelleted 120-Cell, Ko, King of Fire105, and 001 on the Discord

This mod allows you to spare/mercy some bosses, letting them live alongside you.
Each boss has their own pacification requirements, most of which are not hitting the boss for a few minutes while managing to stay alive.
Each boss has a unique effect or town pet version when pacified.

Currently, the mod goes up to and includes all prehardmode bosses, and all hardmode bosses up to Lunatic Cultist/Empress of Light.
